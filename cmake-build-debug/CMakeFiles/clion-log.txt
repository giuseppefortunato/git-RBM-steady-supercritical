CMake Warning (dev) at /home/giuseppe/Programmi/clion/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SMART_MATH)
  does not match the name of the calling package (smart-math).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/modules/LibFindSmart.cmake:37 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  cmake/modules/Findsmart-math.cmake:2 (find_smart)
  cmake/external/smart-math.cmake:5 (find_package)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
